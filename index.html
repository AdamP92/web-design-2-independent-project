        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Ziggys activewear is a clothing brand that has been around since 1992. Originally created in the basement
        of an old warehouse in Kingston Ontario, it has grown into a nationwide venture that employs over 3000 people in factories and offices all over Canada.
        Katy Ziggy was only 9 years old when she borrowed her mothers sewing machine and began making clothing. Her passion for sewing quickly ramped up over the years and eventually she moved into the basement of her fathers shipping
        warehouse to start her very own company at the impressive age of 22 and the rest is history. We've grown and made a lot of progress since our humble beginings back in 1992, and 29 years later Ziggys Activewear continues to grow and be a brand people can count on.</p>
